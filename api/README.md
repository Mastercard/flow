## Overview

This module defines the core types that define the structure of the system model:

 * [Actor][flow.Actor] - elements of the system that can exchange data with each other
 * [Message][flow.Message] - the data that Actors exchange
 * [Interaction][flow.Interaction] - Encapsulates the details of an exchange: The two actors involved and the request/response messages
 * [Flow][flow.Flow] - A contextualised and causally-linked sequence of Interactions
 * [Context][flow.Context] - an aspect of the environment in which a Flow is valid
 * [Residue][flow.Residue] - a persistent change that the flow leaves behind
 * [Metadata][flow.Metadata] - provides human-readable context for a Flow.
 * [Dependency][flow.Dependency] - a relationship between two Flows
 * [Model][flow.Model] - A set of Flows

## Usage

It is unlikely that you'll need to depend directly on this artifact - it will be supplied transitively by [builder](../builder).
