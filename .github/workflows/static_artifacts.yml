# This workflow runs the tests and then dumps the flow reports into our pages branch.
# While we like using bowlby to serve artifacts, it relies on a bunch of perishable
# stuff like an OCI instance, SSL certs and an API token. If any of those go wrong
# we still want to have a working demo of the execution reports.

# Hence this manually-invoked job that dumps a set of reports onto our pages branch
# We can run this whenever something noteworthy changes in the reports and have
# confidence that we'll always have a report to link to in our documentation.
