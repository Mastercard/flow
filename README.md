## Overview

This project provides a framework in which the flow of data in a system can be modelled.
This model can then be:
 * Visualised to provide documentation of system behaviour
 * Used to drive testing of the system 

[This document describes the motivations for this approach](doc/src/main/markdown/motivation/index.md).

## Usage

 * [Quickstart guide](doc/src/main/markdown/quickstart.md): Illustrates the construction of a simple system model and its usage.
 * [Further reading](doc/src/main/markdown/further.md): Covers more advanced usage.
 * The submodules under [example](example) illustrate a complete service constellation with flow-based testing
